Title: 
Cardinal Social Choice System


Problem:
The limitations of traditional voting systems have long intrigued me. Particularly, current
voting systems often force voters into artificial dilemmas, bundling unrelated issues into single choices. Another problem with current systems is their propensity to Mob Rule: modern elections don’t take interest into account, so resolutions that are disproportionately harmful to minority groups often pass. 

Solution:
In my cardinal social choice voting system, n winners are selected from a set of 2n alternatives (options). The system pairs alternatives into n pairwise elections (labeled 0, 1, ..., n−1), and each voter is allowed to distribute a single unit of voting power across the elections according to their preferences. This split encapsulates nuanced voter preferences, and letting the voter distribute the vote incorporates interest into the system.
